# Next Scissors61

This project is aimed to rewrite [scissors61 repo](https://github.com/jeromegrosse/scissors61) to Next JS. The original repo is made using Jekyll, which is not something I am highly familiar with.
This also allow me to do some exploration with Next.js.

## How to start
To start the project, run `npm run dev` go to `http://localhost:3000/`on your favourite browser.
